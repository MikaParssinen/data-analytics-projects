# London bike project
During this project i gathered data from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset  

I used Python to format the data according to my preferences and then exported it to an Excel file.  
After that, I visualized the data in a Tableau Dashboard. See the pictures below:
